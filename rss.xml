            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I only slept for three hours last night, but I'm doing fine. On the way to Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Hospital, I told myself that today would be an extraordinary day, the first time I would talk about my own matters face to face, the first time in my life, hoping not to have any regrets.</p>
<p>As expected, the communication with the doctor went smoothly, without much hesitation or pain. I calmly expressed my thoughts and listened to the doctor's advice.
I just need to do some tests and found out that I have mild anxiety disorder and a slight thyroid problem, which requires treatment.</p>
<p>When I was filling out the blood draw form, the nurse looked at me with a compassionate gaze, and the one who was going to draw blood sighed directly upon seeing me. However, she still gently inserted the needle and instructed me on how to position my hand so that the blood would come out faster. As for me, I calmly looked into their eyes.</p>
<p>During the super-electroencephalogram procedure, I felt like a puppet, manipulated and moved around. I suppose there will be many similar experiences in the future.</p>
<p>Today is peaceful because I know I am doing the right thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been mentally exhausted, so I tried coming out to a friend, hoping it would make me feel a little better.</p>
<p>To my surprise, when I told her everything with a nervous heart, she immediately accepted it.</p>

<p>Later, we talked a lot. I shared my experiences from childhood, when I realized my gender identity, how I discovered my differences, how I hid myself, what kind of people I like, why I moved out of the school dormitory, taking a break from school, giving up, and finally having an awakening. Gradually, I started feeling much better.</p>
<p>When you have a goal, you have to live your life well, understand yourself, and be brave enough to face the world. I hope I can be a better person in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>
