Nevertheless, I only needed to stay there for one night. After taking a shower and preparing for the next day, I went to bed early, knowing that I had to wake up early for the therapy session.\\n\\nIt was a one day therapy session, I reached the hospital at 7:40am, the doctor was not there yet, my appointment is at 8:10am. I was feeling nervous and excited at the same time. I was the second one to arrive. There was a girl who was just like me was also waiting for the doctor. She was wearing a white top and a beautiful long skirt, with long black hair that reached her shoulders. Her exquisite makeup and confident expression added to her charm.\\n\\nAs I looked at myself in the mirror, I couldn\'t help but feel a twinge of insecurity and sadness. \\"If only I could be as confident as her,\\" I thought to myself.\\n\\nI dare not to look at her again, I was afraid that she would notice me staring at her. I took out my phone and started to chat with friends to distract myself. \\n\\nFinally, the doctor arrived. She was called in first.\\n\\nI was called in later and the doctor asked me a lot of questions, I answered them one by one. The doctor checked my breasts and said that they were growing well and healthily. I was so happy to hear that. Also, I was asked to take a blood test, and the result was good. The doctor said that I could taking the hormone therapy with a higher dose.\\n\\nBy the time I left the hospital, it was already 11:30am. I took a lunch at a nearby restaurant and then went to the next hospital to take the voice therapy. The doctor there was very professional and patient. She taught me how to speak in a more feminine way, it was the last session of the voice therapy.\\n\\nAfter the therapy, I went to the bus station and took the bus back to Shenzhen. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the bus. I woke up when the bus arrived at the Shenzhen station. I took a taxi back home and went to bed early.\\n\\nIt was a long day, but I felt happy and satisfied. I was one step closer to becoming the person I wanted to be. I was grateful for the progress I had made and was looking forward to the next therapy session."},{"id":"/2024/2/4/why-learn-algorithms","metadata":{"permalink":"/2024/2/4/why-learn-algorithms","source":"@site/blog/2024-2-4-why-learn-algorithms.md","title":"Why Learn Algorithms?","description":"Four key points","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"algorithms","permalink":"/tags/algorithms"}],"readingTime":0.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Azure Pan","title":"owner of the blog","url":"https://github.com/azurepx","email":"azurepan213@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/azurepx.png","key":"azurep"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why Learn Algorithms?","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"azurep","tags":["algorithms"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Trip to Guangzhou","permalink":"/2024/2/20/a-trip-to-guangzhou"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hospital Visit","permalink":"/2023/10/25/hospital"}},"content":"**Four key points**\\n1.

I calmly expressed my thoughts and listened to the doctor\'s advice.\\nI just need to do some tests and found out that I have mild anxiety disorder and a slight thyroid problem, which requires treatment.\\n\\nWhen I was filling out the blood draw form, the nurse looked at me with a compassionate gaze, and the one who was going to draw blood sighed directly upon seeing me. However, she still gently inserted the needle and instructed me on how to position my hand so that the blood would come out faster. As for me, I calmly looked into their eyes.\\n\\nDuring the super-electroencephalogram procedure, I felt like a puppet, manipulated and moved around.
