I went to Guangzhou by bus on the 19th of February, the day before the one-day therapy session. The journey from Shenzhen to Guangzhou took around 3 hours. I felt a mix of nervousness and excitement. The hotel I stayed in was budget-friendly, but the room was quite small. Nevertheless, I only needed to stay there for one night. After taking a shower and preparing for the next day, I went to bed early, knowing that I had to wake up early for the therapy session.

It was a one day therapy session, I reached the hospital at 7:40am, the doctor was not there yet, my appointment is at 8:10am. I was feeling nervous and excited at the same time. I was the second one to arrive. There was a girl who was just like me was also waiting for the doctor. She was wearing a white top and a beautiful long skirt, with long black hair that reached her shoulders. Her exquisite makeup and confident expression added to her charm.

As I looked at myself in the mirror, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of insecurity and sadness. "If only I could be as confident as her," I thought to myself.

I dare not to look at her again, I was afraid that she would notice me staring at her. I took out my phone and started to chat with friends to distract myself. 

Finally, the doctor arrived. She was called in first.

I was called in later and the doctor asked me a lot of questions, I answered them one by one. The doctor checked my breasts and said that they were growing well and healthily. I was so happy to hear that. Also, I was asked to take a blood test, and the result was good. The doctor said that I could taking the hormone therapy with a higher dose.

By the time I left the hospital, it was already 11:30am. I took a lunch at a nearby restaurant and then went to the next hospital to take the voice therapy. The doctor there was very professional and patient. She taught me how to speak in a more feminine way, it was the last session of the voice therapy.

After the therapy, I went to the bus station and took the bus back to Shenzhen. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the bus. I woke up when the bus arrived at the Shenzhen station. I took a taxi back home and went to bed early.

It was a long day, but I felt happy and satisfied. I was one step closer to becoming the person I wanted to be. I was grateful for the progress I had made and was looking forward to the next therapy session.
