I only slept for three hours last night, but I'm doing fine. On the way to Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Hospital, I told myself that today would be an extraordinary day, the first time I would talk about my own matters face to face, the first time in my life, hoping not to have any regrets.

As expected, the communication with the doctor went smoothly, without much hesitation or pain. I calmly expressed my thoughts and listened to the doctor's advice.
I just need to do some tests and found out that I have mild anxiety disorder and a slight thyroid problem, which requires treatment.

When I was filling out the blood draw form, the nurse looked at me with a compassionate gaze, and the one who was going to draw blood sighed directly upon seeing me. However, she still gently inserted the needle and instructed me on how to position my hand so that the blood would come out faster. As for me, I calmly looked into their eyes.

During the super-electroencephalogram procedure, I felt like a puppet, manipulated and moved around. I suppose there will be many similar experiences in the future.

Today is peaceful because I know I am doing the right thing.
