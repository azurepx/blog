Recently, I have been mentally exhausted, so I tried coming out to a friend, hoping it would make me feel a little better.

To my surprise, when I told her everything with a nervous heart, she immediately accepted it.

```
"Are you referring to being trans woman like Jinxin?"
"Yes."
"Have you made up your mind?"
"I have."
```

Later, we talked a lot. I shared my experiences from childhood, when I realized my gender identity, how I discovered my differences, how I hid myself, what kind of people I like, why I moved out of the school dormitory, taking a break from school, giving up, and finally having an awakening. Gradually, I started feeling much better.

When you have a goal, you have to live your life well, understand yourself, and be brave enough to face the world. I hope I can be a better person in the future.
